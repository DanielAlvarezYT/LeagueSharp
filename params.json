In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Big Thanks to my Mentor\r\n* Developer: SupportExTraGoZ\r\n* Contributors: L# Community and special members you know your names\r\n\r\n### Found a bug?\r\nContact me in forums via PM or in shoutbox.\r\n",
